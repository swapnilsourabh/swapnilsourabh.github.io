I was in the very first year when I thought of doing an internship. I could see many of my seniors who were in the pre-final year applying for various internships and many of them also didn't have prior experience. You could just imagine what went to a fresher's mind on knowing this fact that he was going to do something that is surely gonna fail ! But nevertheless I tried, and started to make a CV!
<br>
But what is a CV? I didn't have any clue how to make that it! So I opened the MS Word (ps: its the worst thing to make a CV, never use it for this purpose) and made a row wise CV with rows like: Name-- Swapnil, Sourabh Age--20 etc. Rather than looking like a CV, it more liked like a bio-data :smile: But who knows, I mailed the CV to almost thirty professors across various institutes with that childish CV! So what you think, did I get any reply? .........To your wonder, yes I got reply from a prof at NITK. He was amused but said  that he only take third year students as intern and said that he can accept me only when I have some skills equivalent to my competitors. This thing got stuck in my mind as I asked myself, do I have some skills that I can even write in my CV? And I realised that I had nothing prominent! So I replied to him that I do not have what he wants but even thanked him, cz he brought me an encouragement to do something so that I can be confident enough...

<br>
Later on , I searched on the net on how to make CVs. And a prepared a more mature CV than the previous one! This time a bit more confidence, I sent it to as many profs I could, somewhat more than 60! I knew I could not make it, I knew I will only get rejections mail but I tried. And one reply came, within 4 minutes of sending the mail. It was written "Happy to be;" . Only these three words. I had no experience, none of my friends had either too, as I was the almost like the first one to send these mails for internships! So I contacted some of my elders and replied to the prof about my happiness if I could get to do a project with him! And he said, that I have to promise that I will come prepared with the studies, and my answer was  
"I assure I come prepared and will leave no stone unturned to prove my worth". But then it seemed that work is more important than words! But I studied various articles on ML and IoT but could understand a bit, but yes my journey had started. When I went to IIT P for the very first time, I was nervous . I had to meet the Ph.D guy whom I had to work with. But to my utter suprise, Rakesh Sir(PhD guy) welcomed me warmly! The first question he asked was "How come so early?" and then he laughed a bit! And I was like , yeah I know it's seems insane! :smile:
